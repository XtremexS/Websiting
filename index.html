        <p class="para">
            I started learning how to code on 26 November 2023 by watching a youtube video (6.5 Hour Course) on how<br>
            to make a youtube homepage from scratch. I learned the basics of making a website using HTML and
            also learned<br> how to use CSS which is used to style and design items inside a website. As the youtube
            video did not fully cover<br> the ways to recreate my ideal website,
            on 19 December 2023, I decided to learn how to make a website by myself<br> using Google and Stack Overflow
            (Coding Forum).
        </p>

        <p class="bookmark">Problems I have faced</p>
        <p class="para">
            There are many problems I faced when making this website over the course of 2 months.<br>
            Firstly, Screen Resolutions. Every person always uses a device to view websites and website<br> appearances
            will differ based on the screen resolution size.
            For example, using a computer to<br> view my website may seem normal in appearance but using a phone to view
            caused the<br> appearance of the website to be much smaller and squashed. I solved this problem with<br>
            Media Queries.<br><br>

            Secondly, understanding different unit measurements. When I was first introduced to<br> website making,
            the deafult and most common unit used was in pixels (PX) which can<br> be used to size any item in the
            website.
            However, not all items in the website should be<br> using the pixels (PX) measurement as it might conflict
            with other things in the future.
            I<br> learned that sizes can also be defined in other measurements like percentages, viewport<br> sizes, and
            Em.<br><br>
            Lastly, using flex boxes and grids to make the items in the website centralised, smooth<br> and flexible
            when adjusted. In the early parts of learning, I struggled to
            understand as<br> my code sometimes did not work when I did not add an extra comma, or bracket which<br> can
            definitely cause the code to malfunction.

        <p class="bookmark">Conclusion</p>
        <p class="para">
            The next coding language I might learn would most likely be Python or Javascript.<br> Python seems to be
            more
            commonly learned in IT-related courses in Temasek Polytechnic<br> and learning it might help me to be more
            familiarised
            in the lessons they teach. Javascript<br> is also implemented inside websites to make specific functions
            like a workable search<br> bar to search things
            and it is also a commonly used coding language.
