        <p class="para">
            I started learning how to code on 26 November 2023 by watching a youtube video (6.5 Hour Course) on how
            to make a youtube homepage from scratch. I learned the basics of making a website using HTML and
            also learned how to use CSS which is used to style and design items inside a website. As the youtube
            video did not fully cover the ways to recreate my ideal website,
            on 19 December 2023, I decided to learn how to make a website by myself using Google and Stack Overflow
            (Coding Forum).

        <p class="header" style="text-decoration: underline;">Problems I have faced</p>
        <p class="para">
            There are many problems I faced when making this website over the course of 2 months.
            Firstly, Screen Resolutions. Every person always uses a device to view websites and website appearances
            will differ based on the screen resolution size.
            For example, using a computer to view my website may seem normal in appearance but using a phone to view
            caused the appearance of the website to be much smaller and squashed. I solved this problem with
            Media Queries.<br><br>

            Secondly, understanding different unit measurements. When I was first introduced to website making,
            the deafult and most common unit used was in pixels (PX) which can be used to size any item in the
            website.
            However, not all items in the website should be using the pixels (PX) measurement as it might conflict
            with other things in the future.
            I learned that sizes can also be defined in other measurements like percentages, viewport sizes, and
            Em.<br><br>
            Lastly, using flex boxes and grids to make the items in the website centralised, smooth and flexible
            when adjusted. In the early parts of learning, I struggled to
            understand as my code sometimes did not work when I did not add an extra comma, or bracket which can
            definitely cause the code to malfunction.

        <p class="header" style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</p>
        <p class="para">
            The next coding language I might learn would most likely be Python or Javascript. Python seems to be
            more commonly learned in IT-related courses in Temasek Polytechnic and learning it might help me to be more familiarised
            in the lessons they teach. Javascript is also implemented inside websites to make specific functions
            like a workable search bar to search things and it is also a commonly used coding language.
